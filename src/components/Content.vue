      <p class="italic font-bold">Who are you?</p>
      <p>Just a citizen of the community. I'm not in it for recognition.</p>
      <p class="italic font-bold">Can you list my organization?</p>
      <p>It depends. I'm primarily trying to help folks find aggregate sources. If I tried to collect every aid organization, I'd never be able to finish. I've tried to provide links to lists being maintained by others. If you know of such a list that I don't have, feel free to send an email to rfisuggestions@outlook.com or tweet @roguefireinfor1.</p>
