      <h2>About this page</h2>
      <p>I've been frustrated by how difficult it is to find updated information on the South Obenchain and Almeda fires since there are so many options, and the situation is still developing. This is my attempt to aggregate some sources that I've found helpful. This site isn't endorsed by any agency, or any of the organizations who are linked here. This is essentially a list of my own bookmarks that you may find useful.</p>
